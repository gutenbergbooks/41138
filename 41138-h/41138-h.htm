<h3>
<span>BONAPARTE AND LORD WHITWORTH.</span>
</h3>

<p>The Rev. J. Sanford has authorised me to place the following letter in
your hands, in order that you may print it in "N. &amp; Q." should it appear
to be of sufficient interest.</p>

<p class="right">B<span class="smcap lowercase">RAYBROOKE</span>.</p>


<p class="blockquot">"I send you an account of the very memorable scene which occurred at
Madame Bonaparte's drawing-room on the 13th of March, 1803. I believe I
am the only living witness, as those who were near the person of Lord
Whitworth were members of the corps diplomatique, Cobenzel, Marcoff,
Lucchesini, all dead. Many years after I became intimately acquainted
with the Marchese Lucchesini at Florence, when I had an opportunity of
referring to that remarkable conversation.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It was announced that Madame Bonaparte was to receive on the following
Sunday, and it was reported that she was to have maids of honour for the
first time; a little curiosity was excited on this score. The apartment
of Madame B. was on the opposite side of the Tuilleries in which
Bonaparte held his levees. I was acquainted with Lord Whitworth, who
told me to place myself near to him, in order to afford facility for
presentation, as Madame B. would occupy an arm-chair to which he
pointed, and on each side of which were two tabourets. As all foreigners
had been presented to General B. at his levee, his presence was not
expected. The rooms, two in number, were not very large; the ladies were
seated round the rooms in arm-chairs: a passage was left, I suppose, for
Madame B. to pass without obstacle. When the door of the adjoining room
was opened, instead of Madame B. the First Consul entered; and as Lord
Whitworth was the first ambassador he encountered, he addressed him by
enquiring about the Duchess of Dorset's health, she being absent from a
cold. He then observed that we had had fifteen years' war; Lord W.
smiled very courteously, and said it was fifteen years too much. We
shall probably, replied General B., have fifteen years more: and if so,
England will have to answer for it to all Europe, and to God and man. He
then enquired where the armaments in Holland were going on, for he knew
of none. Then for a moment<a id="Page_314"></a> <span class="pagenum">[314]</span> he quitted Lord W. and passed all the
ladies' addressing Mrs. Greathead only, though the Duchess of Gordon and
her daughter, Lady Georgina, were present. After speaking to several
officers in the centre of the room, which was crowded, he returned to
Lord W. and asked why Malta was not given up. Lord W. then looked more
serious, and said he had no doubt that Malta would be given up when the
other articles of the treaty were complied with. General B. then left
the room, and Madame B. immediately entered. As soon as the drawing-room
was over, I observed to Lord W. that it was the first cabinet council I
had ever witnessed; he laughingly answered, by far the most numerously
attended. Lord W. then addressed the American Minister, who was very
deaf, and repeated what had passed, and I perceived that he was very
much offended at what had occurred. In justice to the First Consul, I
must say that the impropriety consisted in the unfitness of the place
for such a subject; the tone of his voice was not raised, as was said at
the time. He spoke in the same tone as when he enquired for the Duchess
of Dorset."</p>



<h3>
<span>NOTES ON PRYNNE'S BREVIATE, BY ARCHBISHOP LAUD.</span>
</h3>

<p>I have two Queries to propose; but before I can do so effectually, it is
necessary to enter into an explanation and statement of facts, which may
be considered as Notes conveying information which will, I anticipate,
prove new and interesting to many readers of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<p>On the 2nd of September, 1644, Archbishop Laud, then a man of more than
threescore years and ten, but still with intellect vigorous, active, and
unimpaired by age or trouble, appeared at the bar of the House of Lords,
to recapitulate in one address the various points of his defence, which
had been made at intervals during the six months previous, as the trial
had gone on, from time to time, since the 12th of the preceding March.
On coming to the bar, he was for the moment staggered by seeing, in the
hands of each of his judges, a blue book, containing, as he had just
learnt, great part of his own most secret memoranda and most private
thoughts, extracted by the bitterest of his opponents out of his Diary
and MS. book of devotions. This was Prynne's <i>Breviate of the Life of
William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury; extracted (for the most part)</i>
verbatim <i>out of his own Diary, and other writings, under his own hand</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"So soon as I came to the bar," (this is his own account,) "I saw
   every Lord present with a new thin book in folio, in a blue coat.
   I heard that morning that Mr. Pryn had printed my Diary, and
   published it to the world, to disgrace me. Some notes of his own
   are made upon it. The first and the last are two desperate
   untruths, beside some others. This was the book then in the
   Lords' hands, and I assure myself, that time picked for it, that
   the sight of it might damp me, and disinable me to speak. I
   confess I was a little troubled at it. But after I had gathered
   up myself, and looked up to God, I went on to the business of the
   day, and thus I spake."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>History of Troubles and Trial</i>, c.
   xlii. pp. 411, 412.</p>

<p>In his defence he turned this circumstance, and the use previously made
of his Diary and Devotions during the course of his trial, very happily
to account. After speaking of the means which had been used to frame the
charges against him, how he had been "sifted to the very bran," he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"My very pockets searched; and my Diary, nay, my very Prayer Book
   taken from me, and after used against me; and that, in some
   cases, not to prove, but to make a charge. Yet I am thus far
   glad, even for this sad accident. For by my Diary your Lordships
   have seen the passages of my life; and by my Prayer Book, the
   greatest secrets between God and my soul: so that you may be sure
   you have me at the very bottom. Yet, blessed be God, no
   disloyalty is found in the one; no Popery in the other."</p>

  <p class="author1"><i>Ibid.</i>    c. xliii. p. 413.</p>

<p>The recapitulation over, the Archbishop was remanded to the Tower, and
prosecuted the work on which he had been long engaged, <i>The History of
his Troubles and Tryal</i>: intending, when that was finished, to publish a
reply to this <i>Breviate</i>. His words are:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"For this <i>Breviate</i> of his, if God lend me life and strength to
   end this (the History) first, I shall discover to the world the
   base and malitious slanders with which it is fraught."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>Ibid.</i>    c. xx. p. 254.</p>

<p>His life was not spared to do more than carry on that History to the day
preceding the passing of the bill of attainder by the Lords, three
months after the publication of the <i>Breviate</i>. Thus it ends:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"And thus far had I proceeded in this sad history by Jan. 3,
   1644-45. The rest shall follow as it comes to my
   knowledge."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>Ibid.</i> c. xlvi. p. 443.</p>

<p>Wharton adds this note:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Next day the Archbishop, receiving the news that the bill of
   attainder had passed the House of Lords, broke off his history,
   and prepared himself for death."</p>

<p>He was beheaded the 10th day of the same month, January 1645.</p>

<p>The information I have to communicate, after this long preface, is, that
a copy of this book of Prynne's, with marginal notes by the Archbishop,
made apparently in preparation for the answer which he contemplated, is
still extant; and I shall be thankful to any of your readers who can
give any further information on the subject.</p>

<p>In this copy the notes are only a transcript from those made by the
Archbishop; and partly, perhaps, owing to the narrow margin of Prynne's
book, we have to regret that they are not more<a id="Page_315"></a> <span class="pagenum">[315]</span>] copious; but, such
they are, they are of value, as throwing new light on some points of
history; and they appear not to have been known to any of the
biographers of Laud, or to those who, as Archbishop Sancroft and
Wharton, sought most carefully after his literary remains.</p>

<p>The volume of which I speak is the property of an Institution at
Warrington, "The Warrington Museum and Library," to which it was
presented by Mr. Crosfield, of Fir Grove, Latchford, at the time of the
library being established, in 1848, having been bought by his father at
a book-stall in Manchester some years previously.</p>

<p>A transcript of the notes is now before me; which the Committee of the
Museum have, with great liberality, allowed to be made for the edition
of the Archbishop's works now publishing in <i>The Anglo-Catholic
Library</i>. The readiness which they have shown to impart the benefit of
their collection, and the kindness with which the Hon. Secretary, Mr.
Marsh, has given a full and accurate account of the MS. information, and
himself transcribed the notes, deserve the most public acknowledgment.</p>

<p>That the notes in this volume are not written by the Archbishop is
proved decisively, not only by the handwriting, but by the following
note on Prynne's translation of the <i>Diary</i>, at p. 9. last line,&mdash;"I,
whiles others were absent, held the cup to him," on which the following
is the note:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In y<span class="topnum">t</span> Breviate in which y<span class="topnum">e</span> Archbp. has made [his notes], 'tis
   printed city, and in this place he has [written] 'In my diary
   'tis calicem. Note that....'"</p>

<p>Owing to the edge of the paper being worn, some parts of the note are
lost; they have been conjecturally filled up by the words in brackets.</p>

<p>On the title-page is written, in a hand cotemporary with the transcript:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Memorand. Mr. Prynn presented this worke of his to the Lds. Sep.
   2nd, 1644, y<span class="topnum">e</span> same day that y<span class="topnum">e</span> poor Archbp. was to make his
   recapitulation, divers Lords holding it in their hands all the
   while, &amp;c."</p>

<p>And beneath this, apparently in the same hand, is written:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This I suppose was written by Mr. Dell, secretary to Archbp."</p>

<p>It is inferred that this memorandum had been made by Mr. Dell on the
Archbishop's copy, and transcribed together with the notes.</p>

<p>Now the Queries I have to make are these three:</p>

<p>1. Whether any copies of Prynne's <i>Breviate</i> are extant, having, in the
last line of the ninth page cited above, the misprint <i>city</i> for
<i>cup</i>?<a id="cup1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>2. Whether any information can be given which may lead to the discovery
of the copy containing the original notes of the Archbishop, of which
the Warrington copy is a transcript?</p>

<p>3. Whether any allusion to the fact of the Archbishop having made such
notes is made by any cotemporary writer? Antony Wood, Wharton, and
Heylin do not mention it.</p>

<p>In respect to the second Query, I presume to ask every one who has
access to a copy of Prynne's <i>Breviate</i> to look into it, and see whether
it contains MS. marginal notes. I do so, because in so many cases copies
of works stand in their places in libraries unopened, and with contents
unknown; the knowledge of their special value having perhaps been
possessed by some curious collector or librarian, but not being noted
down, having died with him: and the owner of the volume, should it be
found, will receive his reward in the consciousness of possessing a
treasure, such as it is, which before he knew not of&mdash;some of the last
writing of a great man, imprisoned and anticipating death, who was
engaged in vindicating himself from misrepresentation and calumnies,
part of which had adhered to his memory till these notes came to light.</p>

<p>For the identification of that volume, should it be found, and for the
information of your readers, I will transcribe the first paragraph of
the <i>Breviate</i>, with the Archbishop's <i>marginalia</i>:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Hee was borne at <i>Redding</i> in <i>Barkshire</i>, <i>October 7, 1573</i>, of
   poore (a) and obscure (b) parents, in a cottage (c), just over
   against the (d) Cage: which Cage since his comming to the
   Archbishoprick of <i>Canterbury</i>, upon complaint of Master
   <i>Elveston</i> (that it was a dishonour the Cage should be suffered
   to stand so neare the house, where so great a royall Favourite
   and Prelate had his birth) was removed to some other place; and
   the cottage (e) pulled downe, and new-built by the Bishop."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> (a) "All this, if true, is no fault of mine."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> (b) "My father had born all offices
 in y<span class="topnum">e</span> town save y<span class="topnum">e</span>
   mayoralty."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> (c) "The howsing wh<span class="topnum">ch</span> my father dwelt in is rented at this day
   at thirty-three pounds a year."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> (d) "The Cage stood two streets off from my father's house all
   his life time, and divers years after, as many yet living know.
   By whom it was remov'd into y<span class="topnum">t</span> street, and why out again, I know
   not."</p>

<p class="blockquot">   (e) "No one stick of y<span class="topnum">e</span> cottage was pulled down by me."</p>

<p>The passage which concludes the notes on p. 35. is unfortunately maimed
by the wearing away of the edges of the leaves; it is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">... "And as I hope for comfort in my Saviour this is true ...
   uncharitable conclusion, my life is in y<span class="topnum">e</span> hands of God ...
   blessed be His name. But let not Mr. Pryn call for Blood...."</p>

<p>It should be added that the volume has been formerly in the hands of
some one who took an interest in the Archbishop's history, as a few
notes<a id="Page_316"></a> <span class="pagenum">316</span> in a handwriting of the last century are inserted on slips
in various parts of the volume, chiefly passages from the <i>Diary</i>
"maliciously omitted by Prynne."</p>

<p>The writer of this notice has not the means of identifying the hand by
which these more recent notes, or the transcript of those of the
Archbishop, were written; but will take this occasion of suggesting what
has often appeared to him a great desideratum in literature&mdash;that is, a
collection of fac-similes of the autographs of distinguished people,
whether literary or public characters; not merely their signatures,
which are found in existing collections of autography, but passages
sufficiently long to aid in identifying their ordinary writing, and, if
possible, taken from writing made at different periods of their lives.
With the improvements of mechanical skill which we enjoy, such works
might be afforded at a much cheaper rate than formerly, and would, it is
conceived, command a remunerating sale.</p>

<p>It remains only to add, that information on the points about which
inquiry is made may be communicated through the medium of the "N. &amp; Q.,"
or by letter to the Rev. James Bliss, Ogborne St. Andrew, near
Marlborough, who is engaged in editing the works of Archbishop Laud; and
who would be glad to receive any information with respect to unpublished
letters or papers of the Archbishop.</p>

<h3>
<span>EPITAPH ON VOLTAIRE.</span>
</h3>

<p>I send you two versions of the epitaph on Voltaire given in Vol. iv., p.
73., not for their intrinsic merit, but as illustrations of a curious
physiological trait, as to the nature and power, or powerlessness, of
memory:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Plus bel esprit que grand génie,</p>
      <p>Sans loi, sans m&oelig;urs, et sans vertu,</p>
     <p> Il est mort, comme il a vécu,</p>
      <p>Couvert de gloire et d'infamie."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Version No. 1.:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p class="noindent"> "With far less intellect than wit,</p>
       <p> Lawless, immoral, and debased;</p>
     <p class="noindent"> His life and death each other fit,</p>
        <p>At once applauded and disgraced."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Version No. 2.:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Much more a wit, than man of mind;</p>
      <p>Alike to law, truth, morals blind!</p>
      <p>Consistent as he lived he died,</p>
      <p>His age's scandal, and its pride."</p>

</div>

<p>These are not offered as competing in excellence, for they are both the
productions of the same mind, but for the purpose of recording the
following remarkable fact respecting their composition. No. 2. was
written down immediately on reading your Number in July last (1851);
having composed it, I took from my library shelf Lord Brougham's <i>Life
of Voltaire</i>, in which I knew the lines were, for the purpose of
pencilling in my rendering of them. You may conceive my surprise at
finding already there the version No. 1. with the date 1848, which I had
made in that year, but of which I had so totally lost all remembrance,
that not a single turn of thought or expression in one resembles the
other. I perfectly remember the mental process of hammering out No. 2.,
and can confidently affirm that, during the time, no recollection
whatever of No. 1., or anything about it, ever crossed my thought. I
fear such a total obliteration is a token of failure in a faculty once
powerful and accurate, but, perhaps, unduly tasked; yet I offer it to be
recorded as a singular fact connected with this wonderful function of
mind.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE MILLER'S MELODY, FRAGMENT OF AN OLD BALLAD.</span>
</h3>

<p>When I was a good little boy, I was a favourite visitor to an old maiden
lady, whose memory retained such a store of old ballads and folk-lore as
would be a treasure to many a reader of "N. &amp; Q." were she still living
and able to communicate. One ballad, parts of which, as well as the
tune, still haunt my memory, I have tried to recover in its integrity
but in vain; and of all the little wearers of frocks and pinafores, who
had the privilege of occasionally assembling round the dear old lady's
tea-table, and for whose amusement she was wont to sing it, I fear I am
the sole survivor. The associations connected with this song may perhaps
have invested it with an undue degree of interest to me, but I think it
sufficiently curious to desire to insert as much as I can remember of it
in "N. &amp; Q." in the hope that some of your correspondents may be able to
supply the deficiencies. I wish I could at the same time convey an idea
of the air. It began in a slow quaint strain, with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Oh! was it eke a pheasant cock,</p>
      <p>Or eke a pheasant hen,</p>
     <p> Or was it the bodye of a faire ladye</p>
      <p>Come swimming down the stream?</p>
     <p> Oh! it was not a pheasant cock,</p>
      <p>Nor eke a pheasant hen,</p>
     <p> But it was the bodye of a faire ladye,</p>
      <p>Came swimming down the stream."</p>

</div>

<p>For the next two verses I am at fault, but their purport was that the
body "stopped hard by a miller's mill," and that this "miller chanced to
come by," and took it out of the water "to make a melodye."</p>

<p>My venerable friend's tune here became a more lively one, and the time
quicker; but I can only recollect a few of the couplets, and those not
correctly,<a id="Page_317"></a> <span class="pagenum">[317]</span> nor in order of sequence, in which the transformation
of the lady into a viol is described:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"And what did he do with her fair bodye?</p>
                <p class="i6">  Fal the lal the lal laral lody.</p>
     <p> He made it a case for his melodye,</p>
              <p class="i6"> Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>And what did he do with her legs so strong?</p>
             <p class="i6"> Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>He made them a stand for his violon,</p>
              <p class="i6">Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>And what did he do with her hair so fine?</p>
              <p class="i6">Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>He made of it strings for his violine,</p>
              <p class="i6">Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>And what did he do with her arms so long?</p>
               <p class="i6">Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>He made them bows for his violon,</p>
              <p class="i6"> Fal, &amp;c.</p>
     <p> And what did he do with her nose so thin?</p>
                <p class="i6">Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>He made it a bridge for his violin,</p>
                <p class="i6">Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>And what did he do with her eyes so bright?</p>
              <p class="i6"> Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>He made them spectacles to put to his sight,</p>
               <p class="i6">Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>And what did he do with her petty toes?</p>
             <p class="i6"> Fal, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>He made them a nosegay to put to his nose,</p>
             <p class="i6">Fal, &amp;c.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Doctor Johnson a Prophet.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me where the
following anecdote is recorded? It bears the mark of authenticity, and
if so adds, to the extraordinary gifts of the great moralist, that of
prophecy; be it observed, however, that the prognostication is founded
on a deduction of science. As the Doctor was one evening leaning out of
the window of his house in Bolt Court, Fleet Street, he observed the
parish lamplighter nimbly ascend a ladder for the purpose of lighting
one of the old glimmering oil lamps which only served to make "darkness
visible." The man had scarcely descended the ladder half way, when he
discovered that the flame had expired; quickly returning he lifted the
cover partially, and thrusting the end of his torch beneath it, the
flame was instantly communicated to the wick by the thick vapour which
issued from it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Doctor, after a pause, and giving utterance to his
thoughts, "Ah! one of these days the streets of London will be lighted
by smoke!" It is needless to add that in the succeeding century the
prediction was verified.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Coleridge and Plato.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Without becoming "a piddler in minute
plagiarisms" (as Gifford called Warton), I think the following
coincidence worth noting. S. T. Coleridge, in his "Lines on an Autumnal
Evening," has these lines:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "On seraph wing I'd float a dream by night,</p>
     <p> To soothe my love with shadows of delight;</p>
      <p>Or soar aloft to be the spangled skies.</p>
     <p> And gaze upon her with a thousand eyes."</p>

<p>I cannot withhold Shelley's exquisite version:</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Hair in Seals.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Stillingfleet, referring to a MS. author, who wrote a
chronicle of St. Augustine's, says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "He observes one particular custom of the Normans, <i>that they
   were wont to put some of the hair of their heads or beards into
   the wax of their seals</i>: I suppose rather to be kept as monuments
   than as adding any strength or weight to their charters. So he
   observes, <i>that some of the hair of William, Earl of Warren, was
   in his time kept in the Priory of Lewis</i>."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>To</i> "<i>eliminate</i>."</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The meaning of this word, according both to its
etymology and its usage in the Latin authors, is quite clear; it is to
"turn out of doors." Figuratively, it has been used by mathematicians to
denote the process by which all incidental matters are gradually thrown
out of an equation to be solved, &amp;c., so that only its essential
conditions at last remain. Of late, however, I have observed it used not
of the <i>act</i> of elimination, but of the <i>result</i>; a sense quite foreign
to its true meaning, and producing great ambiguity. Thus, in a recent
Discourse, the object of biblical exegesis is declared to be "the
<i>elimination</i> of the statements<a id="Page_318"></a> <span class="pagenum">[318]</span> of the Bible respecting
doctrine;" the author evidently meaning, not what his words imply,&mdash;to
get rid of the statements of the Bible,&mdash;though that has been sometimes
the problem of exegesis, but to present the doctrinal result in a clear
form, and detached from everything else.</p>

<h3>
<span>ALGERNON SYDNEY.</span>
</h3>

<p>In no way, perhaps, has "N. &amp; Q." been so useful to the literary public
as in making itself the ready means of concentrating on any given point
the various readings of many persons; unless, indeed, it should be
considered more useful to have proved how courteous, how willing to
oblige&mdash;even at some personal sacrifices&mdash;men of reading are in this day
and generation. The information recently sent from so many quarters in
relation to General Wolfe is a good example of what may be done in other
cases; that about Sterne in Paris is another. The latter instance
suggests to me a way in which some of your correspondents, whose private
communications I have had to acknowledge in reference to other
inquiries, might do me a real service at no great inconvenience perhaps
to themselves.</p>

<p>I am collecting materials for a volume on Algernon Sydney. A great part
of this illustrious patriot's life was spent abroad; in many parts of
the continent, France, Holland, Denmark, Italy, Germany, &amp;c. This part
of his history has been so far veiled in considerable obscurity, and
incidents of it misrepresented. Some better knowledge of it than we now
possess, must be, I think, recoverable. A man of Sydney's birth, active
temperament, and distinguished abilities, must have been spoken of in
many letters and memoirs of that time. No doubt anecdotes and traits of
character may be found in cotemporary French, Italian, German, and
Scandinavian literature.</p>

<p>But with a library so vast to examine, no single man could ever feel
sure that nothing was overlooked. Other explorers, working for
themselves, may have hit upon statements or anecdotes of the greatest
value to me. May I ask any such to oblige me by references to any works
in which the information that I seek is to be found; sent either to "N.
&amp; Q.," or to my address as under?</p>

<h3>
<span>OLD IRISH TALES.</span>
</h3>

<p>A black-letter duodecimo, printed in London in 1584, under the anomalous
title of <i>Beware the Cat</i>, was advertised for sale in one of Thorpe's
Catalogues a few years back, at a price of seven guineas. The copy was
believed to be unique; it had been in the libraries of several book
collectors, and among others of Mr. Heber, who considered it the most
curious volume illustrative of the times, in all his vast collection. It
appears, by the short abstract of contents, that the book contains some
curious notices of Ireland and Irishmen; an "account" is given "of the
civil wars in Ireland, by Mackmorro, and all the rest of the wild Irish
lords." This hero was probably Art Kavanagh, "the Mac-Morrogh" (the
hereditary title of the chief of the Leinster septs) whose rebellions
were, on two occasions, the cause of Richard II.'s two great expeditions
to Ireland. Then follows the tale of "Fitz-Harris and the Prior of
Tintern Abbey." Fitz-Harris, or Fitz-Henry, was an Anglo-Irish baron,
who resided in the south of the county of Wexford, in the neighbourhood
of a convent, which having been founded by Marshal, Earl of Pembroke,
and supplied with monks from Tintern in Monmouthshire, was named after
the parent monastery. The Fitz-Harris's are said to have descended from
Meyler Fitz-Henry, the "indomitor totius gentis Hiberniæ," but they
became, to quote Spenser's adage current of the Anglo-Irish of his day,</p>

 <div class="poem">

 <p> "As Irish as O'Hanlan's breech;"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">they "matched with the Kavanaghs of Carlow, and held with them," and
thus became involved in the interminable feuds of the native tribes,
and, like them, they left their estates to their bastards.</p>

<p>"The fashion of the Irish wars at that time" is there described, but
probably not more graphically than in Derrick's quaint doggrel verses.
"The Irish Churle's Tale" is next told; the churl was the husbandman,
the "Protectionist" of the day, who doubtless could tell many piteous
tales of oppression, rapine, and ravishment, whose only hope of
protection lay in acting as a sort of sponge to some "wild lord" (who
would guard him from being plundered by others, that he might himself
devour his substance), and whose "tenant-right" cry of that day was
"spend me, but defend me."</p>

<p>The volume affirms that "the wild Irishmen were better than we in
reverencing their religion:" the verb is used in the preterimperfect
tense. "The old Irish diet was to dine at night;" this is even a
stranger assertion. Higden, in his <i>Polychronicon</i>, declares of the
Irish clergy,</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p>"They ben chaste, and sayen many prayers, and done great
   abstinence a-day, and drinketh all night."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">That glorious <i>chanson à boire</i>, commencing</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "I cannot eat but little meat,</p>
        <p class="i2">My stomach is not good;</p>
      <p>But I do think that I can drink</p>
       <p class="i2">With him that wears a hood!"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">must have been composed in Ireland. If the old black-letter book had
said that the Irish <i>got their dinner</i> at night, it would have been
nearer the<a id="Page_319"></a> <span class="pagenum">[319]</span> truth, for the larders of the Milesian chiefs in the
neighbourhood of the English pale were often supplied by the nocturnal
marauds of their cattle-lifters. However, I see that Stanihurst writes
that the Irish dined in winter <i>before</i> day, and in summer about the
seventh hour.</p>

<p>&mdash;Would you, or one of your correspondents, kindly
inform me how the following case has been settled; it is one which in
all probability has often arisen, but I have not yet been able to learn
anything about it that is satisfactory.</p>

<p>In old times when a church became too small for the parish, the ordinary
custom was to build an additional part to it in such a way that the old
church, after the alteration, formed an aisle to the new part, which
henceforth because the nave. Until the Reformation the altar in the old
chancel would probably remain after the new chancel was built, and be
used as an inferior altar, while the new altar would be used for high
mass; under these circumstances the rector's right in the chancel would
probably remain untouched, and his obligation to keep it in repair
undisputed. But when, at the Reformation, all but high altars were taken
away, which chancel was accounted the rector's, the new, or the old, or
both? This question has just arisen in an adjoining county.</p>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents inform us
whether the Queen is really Duchess of Lancaster? The Lancastrians have
always rather prided themselves on that circumstance, but some wise
person has lately made the discovery that William III. never created
himself Duke of Lancaster, nor any of the Hanoverian dynasty, and that
consequently the title remains with the Stuarts, although the duchy
privileges belong to the Crown. Is this really the truth?</p>

their mortal remains deposited in some loved spot, far away from other
graves,&mdash;in a scene where many happy hours had been passed. It would be
a very unusual thing; but supposing such a desire to exist, could its
execution be prevented? It is recorded that Manasseh, King of Judah,
"slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house,
in the gardens of Uzza."&mdash;2 Kings xxi. 18.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">[A very old man, in our younger days, whose informant lived temp.
   Jac. II., used to explain it thus:&mdash;When the Conqueror marched
   from Dover towards London, he was stopped at Swansconope, by
   Stigand, at the head of the "Men of Kent," with oak boughs "all
   on their brawny shoulders," as emblems of peace, on condition of
   his preserving inviolate the Saxon laws and customs of Kent; else
   they were ready to fight unto the death for them. The Conqueror
   chose the first alternative: hence we retain our Law of
   Gavelkind, &amp;c., and hence the inhabitants of the part of Kent
   lying between Rochester and London, being "invicti," have ever
   since been designated as "Men of Kent," while those to the
   eastward, through whose district the Conqueror marched unopposed,
   are only "Kentish Men." This is hardly a satisfactory account;
   but we give it as we had it.</p>

   <p>We suspect the <i>real</i> origin of the terms to have been, a mode of
   distinguishing any man whose family had been long settled in the
   county (from time immemorial, it may be), from new settlers; the
   former being genuine "Men of Kent," the latter only "Kentish."
   The monosyllabic name of the county probably led to this play

<p>&mdash;The appearance in your pages of several very
interesting Notes on the First Paper-mill in England leads me to beg
space for a few Queries on another subject of Art-History.</p>

<p>1. <i>When</i>, <i>where</i>, and under what circumstances, was the first
manufactory for <i>glass</i> established in England?</p>

<p>2. What writer first notices the introduction or use of glass, in our
island?</p>

<p>3. Are there any works of authority published devoted to this material?
If so, may I request some of your learned contributors to direct me to
them, or, in fact, to any good notice of its early history?</p>

 <p class="right">G.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> [John Le Neve was born in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, Dec.

   Cambridge, where he remained three years. He married Frances, the
   second daughter of Thomas Boughton, of King's Cliffe, in
   Northamptonshire, by whom he had four sons and four daughters. He
   died about 1722. Mr. Lysons, in <i>Environs of London</i>, says he had
   a house at Stratford, Bow. (See Nichols's <i>Lit. Anecdotes</i>, vol.
   i. p. 128.) In Cole's MSS., vol. i. p. 143., is the following

<p>&mdash;At page 437. of Lloyd's <i>Statesmen and Favourites of

John Norris, written upon the occasion of the death of the said Sir
John, which she commences thus: "My own Crow." This appears to me a very
curious mode of address, particularly from a queen to a subject, and
seems to mark a more than ordinary intimacy between the correspondents,
for it has been suggested to me that it is still used as a term of
endearment, in the same way as "duck," &amp;c. are used: I have, however,
never before met with it myself, and have sent you a Note of it now, not
only because I consider it curious that the queen should thus write, but
because I hope that some of your correspondents may be able to suggest
how this word came to be thus used.</p>

<h3><span>PRESBYTERIAN OATH.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 274.)</span>
</h3>

<p>No such oath as that given in page 274. of "N. &amp; Q." is taken by
Presbyterian ministers. Immediately previous to the ordination of a
minister of the church of Scotland, the Moderator&mdash;that is, the member
of Presbytery who presides upon the occasion&mdash;calls upon him to answer
certain questions, acknowledging the Scriptures to be the word of God,
the doctrines of the Confession of Faith to be the truth of God;
disowning certain doctrinal errors; declaring his belief that the
Presbyterian government and discipline of this church are founded on the
word of God, and agreeable thereto; expressing the views with which he
enters the ministry, and his resolution faithfully to discharge its
duties. Having answered these questions satisfactorily, he is set aside
to the work of the ministry by prayer and imposition of the hands of the
Presbytery (the local Ecclesiastical Court).</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the service he is called on to sign what is called
the Formula, an abstract of the first portion of the questions put to
him. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I, A. B., do hereby declare, that I do sincerely own and believe
   the whole doctrine contained in the Confession of Faith, approven
   by the General Assemblies of this national church, and ratified
   by law in the year 1690, and frequently confirmed by divers acts
   of parliament since that time, to be the truths of God; and I do
   own the same as the confession of my faith: as likewise, I do own
   the purity of worship presently authorised and practised in this
   church, and also the Presbyterian government and discipline now
   so happily established therein; which doctrine, worship, and
   church government, I am persuaded, are founded upon the word of
   God, and agreeable thereto: and I promise that, through the grace
   of God, I shall firmly and constantly adhere to the same; and to
   the utmost of my power, shall, in my station, assert, maintain,
   and defend the said doctrine, worship, discipline, and government
   of this church by Kirk Sessions, Presbyteries, Provincial Synods,
   and General Assemblies; and that I shall in my practice conform
   myself to the said worship, and submit to the said discipline and
   government, and never endeavour directly or indirectly the
   prejudice or subversion of the same: and I promise that I shall
   follow no divisive course from the present establishment in this
   church: renouncing all doctrines, tenets, and opinions
   whatsoever, contrary to or inconsistent with the said doctrine,
   worship, discipline, or government of this church.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Signed, A. B."</p>

<p>No oath is taken, and no obligation come under but the above. In the
Confession of Faith, under the head Church, the supremacy of the Pope is
denied; but neither in that, the Questions, or the Formula, is there any
other reference to any other form of church government.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE OLD COUNTESS OF DESMOND.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 145.)</span>
</h3>


<p>As there has been, from time to time, much written in your very
interesting publication on the subject of the "Old Countess of Desmond,"
it may, perhaps, not be unacceptable that I should give you a
description of an old family picture in my possession, said to be of
that person, to which allusion has been made by some of your
correspondents, especially by A. B. R., in your paper of Saturday, 14th
February. The painting in question has been for a great number of years
in the possession of my family, and from my earliest childhood I have
heard it designated as that of the old "Countess of Desmond," although
there is no mention of her name thereon. My father for a long time
thought it was a work of Rembrandt; but on a close examination there was
discovered the name of "G. Douw," low at the left-hand side; and since
the picture has been cleaned, the signature has become more distinct. It
is painted on board of dark-coloured oak, of eleven inches by eight and
a half. The portrait, which reaches to below the bust, and represents a
person sitting, is<a id="Page_324"></a> <span class="pagenum">[324]</span> eight and a half inches in length; the face
about two and three quarter inches. It is admitted by the best judges to
be a painting of great merit. It represents, as well as it is possible,
extreme old age, with an extraordinary degree of still remaining vigour,
and in this respect certainly fits exactly the character of its subject.
The dress is correctly described by your correspondent A. B. R. The
forehead is not very high, but square and intellectual&mdash;deeply wrinkled;
the nose is rather long, and very well formed; the eyes dark; the mouth
compressed, and denoting quiet firmness; the expression altogether
pleasing and placid, and the face one that must have been handsome in
youth. Should any of your correspondents wish to see this picture, I
shall leave it for a short time in the hands of my bookseller, Mr.
Newman, 3. Bruton Street, Bond Street, who has kindly consented to take
charge of it, and to show it to those who feel an interest in such
matters.</p>

<p>It must, at first sight, appear strange that such men as G. Douw, the
painter of the picture in question, or Rembrandt to whom are attributed
other portraits of this old lady, should have condescended to copy from
other artists, (for the respective dates render it quite impossible they
could have painted from life in this instance): however, it is natural
to suppose that this extraordinary instance of longevity made great
noise at the time of, and for some time after, her death, and that a
correct representation of such a physical phenomenon, although the work
of an inferior artist, may well have afforded a fitting study for even
such eminent painters as Rembrandt and G. Douw.</p>

<p>As I am on this subject, I shall further trouble you with a circumstance
in connexion therewith, which has recently come to my knowledge. My
friend, Mr. Herbert, M.P., of Muckross Abbey, Killarney, has also an old
family picture of the same lady, with a very curious inscription, which,
while it would appear to go far towards establishing several of her
characteristic attributes, has also its peculiar difficulties, which I
shall presently point out, in the hope that some of your correspondents
who are learned in such matters may explain them. The inscription, which
is on the canvass itself, is as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Catharine, Countesse of Desmonde, as she appeared at y<span class="topnum">e</span> court
   of our Sovraigne Lord King James, in thys preasant <span class="smaller">A.D</span>. 1614, and
   in y<span class="topnum">e</span> 140<span class="topnum">th</span> yeare of her age. Thither she came from Bristol
   to seek relief, y<span class="topnum">e</span> house of Desmonde having been ruined by
   Attainder. She was married in y<span class="topnum">e</span> Reigne of King Edward IV., and
   in y<span class="topnum">e</span> course of her long Pilgrimage renewed her teeth twice: her
   Principal residence is at Inchiquin, in Munster, whither she
   undoubtedlye proposeth (her Purpose accomplished) incontinentlie
   to return. L<span class="smcap lowercase">AUS</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">DEO</span>."</p>

<p>Now, as to the authenticity of this picture, there can, I should think,
be no question. It has not been <i>got up</i> for the present antiquarian
controversy; for it is known to have been in existence in the family of
Mr. Herbert for a great many years. It could not well be a mystification
of the intervening "middle age," for in that case it would doubtless
have been brought forward at <i>the time</i>, to establish a particular
theory as to this lady. I think, therefore, it is only reasonable to
suppose that it was painted at the time it professes. It may also be
mentioned, in corroboration, that a connoisseur who examined this
picture for Mr. Herbert attributed it to the hand of Jamieson, the
Scotch painter, who lived at a time that would render it quite possible
for him to have painted it from life. So far so good. The main
difficulty is that of the dates given in the inscription. If the
Countess was 140 in 1614, and therefore born in 1474, she could have
been but eight or nine years old at the death of Edward IV., and
therefore could not have been married in his reign. It is difficult to
account for this discrepancy, except by supposing that the old lady sank
ten years of her age (and there are statements in existence of 1464
being the year of her birth); or else by supposing that the story of her
marriage in the reign of Edward IV. was not her own, but communicated,
at second-hand and erroneously, to the artist.</p>

<p>On this point I hope some of your more learned correspondents will
favour us with their opinion. There has also been recently sent me by a
friend an extract from the "Birch Collection," British Museum (Add. MSS.
4161.), being transcripts of a <i>Table Book of Robert Sidney, second Earl
of Leicester</i>, which contradicts the inscription in some particulars:
but Lord Leicester writes in a loose and apparently not very authentic
style. He states, on the authority of a "Mr. Harnet," that the Countess
of Desmond came to petition "the Queen" (Elizabeth), and not King James;
and quotes Sir W. Raleigh (on memory) as saying that he (Sir W. R.) saw
her in England in 1589. He also talks of her death as occurring at the
end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and as being caused by a fall from
a "nutt-tree." I do not think, indeed, that much weight should attach to
these notes of Lord Leicester; but it is fair to give all that comes to
light, whether it makes against or for the authenticity of what one
wishes to establish.</p>

<h3>
<span>SHAKSPEARE'S SICKLE OR SHEKEL.<br />
(<i>Value of Solidus Gallicus?</i>)<br />
(Vol. v., p. 277.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I undertake to answer C. W. B.'s Query with the greater readiness,
because it affords me an opportunity of upholding that which has ever
been<a id="Page_325"></a> <span class="pagenum">[325]</span> the leading object in every amendment of Shakspeare's text
advocated by me, viz., the unravelling and explaining, rather than the
alteration, of the original. Perhaps it is with a similar aim that C. W.
B. wishes to investigate the value of "siclus;" if so, he must pardon me
if I forestall him.</p>

<p>I see no difficulty in the passage which he asks to have construed; its
meaning is this:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "The sacred sickle (or shekel) was equivalent to an Attic
   tetradrachma, which Budæus estimated at 14 Gallic solidi, or
   thereabouts; for the didrachma was seven solidi, since the single
   drachma made three and a half solidi, <i>less</i> a denier Tournois."</p>

<p>Which is as much as to say, that the sickle equalled fourteen solidi,
less four deniers; or 13-2/3 solidi.</p>

<p>But owing to the rapid declension in the value of French coin after the
tenth century, it is manifestly impossible to assign a value to these
solidi unless the precise date of their coinage were known. A writer
may, of course, allude to coin indefinitely precedent to his own time.
In the present case, however, we may, as a matter of curiosity,
<i>analytically</i> approximate to a result in this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>The drachma is now known to have contained about 65 grains of pure
silver, consequently the tetradrachma contained 260 grains. The present
franc contains about 70 grains of pure silver, and consequently the sol,
or 20th part, is 3-1/2 grains.</p>

<p>This last, multiplied by 13-2/3, produces about 48 grains. But the
weight of the tetradrachma is 260 grains; therefore the sol with which
the comparison was made must have contained upwards of fivefold its
present value in pure silver.</p>

<p>Now, according to the depreciation tables of M. Dennis, this condition
obtained in 1483, under Charles VIII., at which time Budæus was actually
living, having been born in 1467; but from other circumstances I am
induced to believe that the solidus gallicus mentioned by him was coined
by Louis XII. in 1498, at which time the quantity of pure silver was
fourfold and a half that of the present day.</p>

<p>So much in answer to C. W. B.'s Query; now for its relation to
Shakspeare's text, with which however the "siclus" in question has
nothing in common except the name; since the "sickles," so beautifully
alluded to by Isabella, in <i>Measure for Measure</i> (Act II. Sc. 2.), were
<i>sicli aurei</i>, "of the tested gold."</p>

<p>But I have designedly used the word <i>sickle</i> as the English
representative of the Latin <i>siclus</i> (Gallicè <i>cicle</i>), because it is
the original word of Shakspeare, which was subsequently, most
unwarrantably and unwisely, altered by the commentators to <i>shekels</i> in
conformity with the Hebraicised word of our scriptural translation.<a id="ion2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Hence it is that "sickles" has come to be looked upon as <i>a corruption
of the text</i>; and "shekels" as a very clever <i>conjectural emendation</i>!</p>

<p>We retain <i>sickle</i>, Anglicè for <i>sicula</i>, a scythe; but we refuse it to
Shakspeare for a word almost identical in sound&mdash;<i>siculus</i>, or siclus!</p>

<p>The real corruption has been that of Shakspeare's commentators, not his
printers'; and I hope that some future editor of his plays will have the
courage to permit him to spell this, and other proper names, in his own
way. For how can his text continue to be an example of his language, if
his words may be altered to suit the <i>précieuse</i> fashion of subsequent
times?</p>

<h3>
<span>A FEW MORE WORDS ABOUT "DULCARNON."<br />
(Vol. i., p. 254.; Vol. v., pp. 252-3.)</span>
</h3>

<p>By the aid of Dr. Adam Littleton and your correspondent A. N., all
future editors of Chaucer and glossarists are helped over this <i>pons
asinorum</i>: the word being evidently nothing more than the adoption of
the Arabic <span class="smaller">DHU 'LKARNEIN</span>, i.e. <i>two-horned</i>; and hence, as the reputed
son of Jupiter Ammon, Alexander's oriental name, Iscander <i>Dhu
'lkarnein</i>, i.e. Bicornis.</p>

<p>The legend of the building of the wall, in the fabulous Eastern lives of
Alexander, is to be found in the 18th chapter of the Koran; and it is
related with variations and amplification by Sir John Mandeville. The
metrical as well as prose romances on the subject of Alexander also
contain it; and those who wish for more information will find it in the
third volume of Weber's <i>Metrical Romances</i>, p. 331.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I am quite convinced of the truth of the ingenious
supposition of your correspondent, that "Sending to Dulcarnein is merely
an ellipsis of the person for his place, <i>i.e.</i> for the rampart of
Dulcarnein." It appears to me more probable, that as, according to St.
Jerome and other writers of the Middle Ages, the <i>Dilemma</i> was also
called Syllogismum <i>Cornutum</i>, its Arabic name was <i>Dhu 'lkarnein</i>; and
we know how much in science and literature the darker ages were indebted
to the Arabian writers. Wyttenbach, in his <i>Logic</i>, says "<i>Dilemma</i>
etiam <i>Cornutus</i> est; quod <i>utrimque</i> veluti <i>Cornibus</i> pugnat." At any
rate it is clear that the enclosure had another name:<a id="Page_326"></a> <span class="pagenum">[326]</span></p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>It does not appear to me that <i>to be at Dalcarnon</i> is equivalent to
being <i>sent to Coventry</i>, or to Jericho, as your correspondent A. N.
supposes; or that the word <i>flemyng</i>, in this passage, means
<i>banishing</i>, but rather <i>defeating</i>, <i>daunting</i>, <i>dismaying</i>, in which
sense it occurs more than once in Layamon; thus, vol. ii. p. 410.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Thine feond <i>flæmen</i></p>
    <p>  &amp; driven hem of londen."</p>

</div>

<p>The general sense of the word is, however, <i>to expel</i>, <i>to drive out</i>,
and not <i>to enclose</i>, as Alexander is said to have done the Gog and
Magog people, by his iron, or rather bituminous, wall. Now those who
were at Dulcarnon, or <i>in a Dilemma</i>, might well be said to be defeated
or dismayed.</p>

<p>Let us hope that some oriental scholar among your correspondents may be
able to indicate where the word is to be found in some Arabian expositor
of logic or dialectic, &amp;c., and thus set the question entirely at rest.</p>

<p>Are we never to have an edition of Chaucer worthy of him, and creditable
to us? Had our northern neighbours possessed such a treasure, every MS.
in existence would have been examined and collated, and the text
settled. His language would have been thoroughly investigated and
explained,<a id="ned3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and every possible source of elucidation made available.
May we not hope that the able editor of Layamon and Wickliffe will yet
add to the obligation every lover of our early literature owes to him,
an edition of our first great poet, such as his previous labours have
shown that he is so well qualified to give?</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ned3" class="label">[3]</a> This is evident from the interest the Germans have
manifested, <i>e.g.</i> the younger Gesenius, in his able essay, <i>De Lingua
Chauceri Commentationem Grammaticam</i>; and Edward Fiedler's <i>Translation
of the Canterbury Tales</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span>ENGLISH SURNAMES.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 290.)</span>
</h3>


<p>I have, as most of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." are aware, for a
considerable time past turned my attention to the subject of <i>English
Surnames</i>, and the sale of three editions of my work under that title
shows that such a book was a desideratum. Chapters on the origin of
surnames exist in Camden's <i>Remaines</i>, Verstegan's <i>Restitution</i>, and
elsewhere, and there are detached notices in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
and other periodicals; but my work is the first, and as yet the <i>only</i>
independent treatise on the subject. Any one who will be at the trouble
to compare my first and third editions will at once see how this inquiry
has grown under my hands; but although I have collected and classified
6000 names, much still remains to be accomplished. Under this
conviction, I am now engaged in the compilation of a <i>Dictionary of
English Family Names</i>, which I hope to complete within the present year.
My plan will include:</p>

<p class="indh">I. The name.</p>

<p class="indh">II. The class to which it belongs. The classes will be about twenty in
number.</p>

<p class="indh">III. The etymology of each name when necessary.</p>

<p class="indh">IV. Definitions and remarks.</p>

<p class="indh">V. Illustrative quotations from old English authors.</p>

<p class="indh">VI. The century in which the name first occurs.</p>

<p class="indh">VII. The corruptions and most remarkable variations which the name has
undergone.</p>

<p class="indh">VIII. Proverbs associated with family names, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"All the <i>Tracys</i></p>

posterity of Wm. de Traci, one of the assassins of Thos. à Becket.</p>

<p class="indh">IX. Anecdotes and traditions.</p>

<p>My object in making this statement, is to solicit from the numerous and
learned correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." contributions of surnames and
suggestions in furtherance of my undertaking; and from the Editor,
permission to query from time to time upon the origin, date, and history
of such surnames as I am unable satisfactorily to elucidate without
assistance. A field so large requires the co-operation of many
labourers. I have already secured the friendly aid of some of the most
competent antiquaries in England; and I confidently anticipate for the
forthcoming collection a degree of success proportioned to the amount of
labour and research bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>Of <i>local</i> surnames few will be introduced; for, as nearly every landed
property has given a name to the family of its early proprietor, it
would be impossible to include all the names so derived. Only the more
remarkable ones of this class, which would appear at first sight to come
from a totally different source, will be admitted. Blennerhasset,
Polkinghom, Woodhead, Wisdom, Bodycoat, and Crawl, for example, are
names of places, and surnames have been derived from them, although few
except the persons resident in the particular localities are aware that
any such places exist. Most of the names that baffle all historical and
etymological acumen are probably of this class.</p>

<p>I wish it to be understood that my dictionary<a id="Page_327"></a> <span class="pagenum">[327]</span> will only include
family, that is, <i>hereditary</i> surnames. Merely personal sobriquets which
died with their first possessors (and which are found in large numbers
in ancient records) will be passed by, unless they should illustrate
some appellative which has descended to our times.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this work is by no means intended to supersede my
<i>English Surnames</i>, which contains much matter unsuited to dictionary
arrangement, and is intended to convey information on a neglected
subject in a popular form. The illustrations in the <i>Dictionary</i> will
for the most part be new, with references to the <i>English Surnames</i> for
others.</p>

<p>The foregoing announcement was intended to be sent to "N. &amp; Q." some
weeks since. I am now induced to forward it without further delay,
because I see the subject of surnames introduced in to-day's number by
two different correspondents. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OWGILL</span>, the first of these, could, if so
disposed, render me efficient help. As to the remarks of J. H. on the
works of "Lower and others" (<i>what others?</i>), they clearly show that he
has never read what he so summarily condemns, or he would not now have
to ask for the supposed number of surnames in England, which is given in
my third edition, vol. i., preface, p. xiii. Though I am, perhaps, more
fully aware than any other person of the defects and demerits of my
<i>English Surnames</i>, I think the literary public will hardly deny me the
credit of "<i>some</i> study and research," praise which has been awarded me
by better critics than J. H. It is not my practice to notice the
censures of anonymous writers, but I cannot forbear adverting to two
points in J. H.'s short communication. In the first place his desire for
a work giving <i>all</i> the names used in England, and "showing when they
were first adopted or brought into this country," shows his entire want
of acquaintance with the existing state of the nomenclature of English
families. A glance at a few pages of so common a book as the <i>London
Directory</i>, will convince any competent observer that there are hundreds
upon hundreds of surnames that would baffle the most imaginative
etymologist. Secondly, J. H. proposes that an author treating on the
subject of family names, should begin "with the Britons." Does he really
suppose that the Celtic possessors of our island bore family names
according to the modern practice? If so, "Lower and (many) others" can
assure him that his antiquarian and historical knowledge must be of a
somewhat limited kind.</p>

<h3>
<span>REV. JOHN PAGET.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 133.; Vol. v., pp. 66. 280.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Since the Notes, kindly transmitted from Holland in answer to my Query
respecting the family of the Rev. John Paget, appeared in "N. &amp; Q.," I
have discovered that the Pagets to whom my Query related, as well as the
others alluded to by your correspondents, were all of the family of
Paget of Rothley, Leicestershire, of whom a (partially incomplete)
pedigree is given in Nichols's <i>Leicestershire</i>, vol. iv. p. 481. I was
led to this conclusion by finding that Robert Paget (the writer of a
preface before alluded to "from Dort, 1641") mentions in his will
Roadley (Rothley) in Leicestershire as his birthplace, and speaks of his
brother George as residing in his "patrimoniall house" there: he is
probably the Robert, son of Michael Paget, and great-grandson of the
Rev. Harold Paget, vicar of Rothley in 1564, who is mentioned in the
pedigree as born at Rothley in 1611: he died at Dordt in 1684. The
pedigree gives him an uncle named Thomas, born in 1589 (two indeed of
that name, and both born the same year!); this will do very well for the
Rev. Thomas Paget, incumbent of Blackley, and rector of Stockport; and
another named John, who died, aged seven, in 1582: still I cannot help
believing that John Paget, the writer, was this Robert's uncle, and feel
mightily disposed to metamorphose one of the two Thomases into John. The
Rev. Thomas Paget died in October, 1660, leaving his property to his two
sons, Nathan M.D., and Thomas a clergyman. What relation was he to that
Mr. Paget to whom Dee, the astrologer (see his <i>Diary</i>, p. 55. Camden
Society, 1842), sold a house in Manchester in 1595? His son, Dr. Nathan,
in a <i>Thesis on the Plague</i>, printed at Leyden in 1639, describes
himself on the title-page as Mancestr-Anglus. According to Mr. Paget's
will, dated May 23, 1660, he was then minister at Stockport, Cheshire;
and I am inclined to think him identical with Thomas Paget, rector of
St. Chads, Shrewsbury, from 1646 to 1659, although Owen and Blakeway
(<i>History of Shrewsbury</i>, 2 vols. 4to. 1825) consider the latter to be
son of John (James?) Paget, Baron of the Exchequer, temp. Car. I.: this
descent is, I am confident, erroneous. Thomas Paget appears to have gone
to Amsterdam in 1639 on the death of the Rev. John Paget, and to have
returned to England in 1646, in which year his son John (who must have
been much younger than his two other sons, and is, moreover, not
mentioned in his will dated 1660) was baptized at Shrewsbury. Dr. Nathan
Paget was an intimate friend of Milton, and cousin to the poet's fourth
wife, Elizabeth Minshull, of whose family descent (which appears to be
rather obscure) I may, at another time, communicate some
particulars.<a id="Page_328"></a> <span class="pagenum">[328]</span></p>

<p>Whilst the subject of the Pagets (a very interesting one to me), I
cannot refrain from noticing, even at the risk of encroaching on your
space, a singular mistake of Anthony à Wood respecting another writer
(though of an entirely different family) of the name of Paget. Speaking
of the Rev. Ephraim Paget (<i>Athen. Oxon.</i>, vol. ii. p. 51.) he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"One of both his names (his uncle I think) translated into
   English <i>Sermons upon Ruth</i>, Lond. 1586, in oct., written
   originally by Lod. Lavater; but whether the said Ephraim Paget
   was educated at Oxon, I cannot justly say, though two or more of
   his sirname and time occur in our registers."</p>

<p class="noindent">Had Anthony ever <i>seen</i> the book in question, he would have been aware
that the title-page informs him that it was translated by Ephraim
Pagitt, a child of eleven years of age; and as, according to the said
Anthony's account, Ephraim was born in 1575, he would also at once have
seen that Ephraim himself&mdash;not that ideal personage, his "uncle of the
same name"&mdash;was the translator.</p>

<h3>
<span>LETTER TO A BRIGADIER-GENERAL.<br />
(Vol. v., p 296.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Your correspondent W. C. begins his letter modestly. "If," he says,
Thomas Lord Lyttleton wrote <i>The Letters of Junius</i>, and "if" Junius
wrote the "Letter to the Brigadier-General," then he sees a difficulty.
Why, of course he does: but as nobody but the writer in the <i>Quarterly</i>
believes that the said Thomas did write the <i>Letters of Junius</i>, and as
it has never been proved that Junius did write the "Letter to a
Brigadier," I must believe that something remains to be done before we
proceed a step farther either in the way of argument or inference.
Unless some such resolution be come to by inquirers, we shall never get
out of the mazes in which this question has been involved, by like
conditional statements, and the conditional arguments founded thereon.</p>

<p>As to the Lyttleton story, I shall dismiss it at once: it is not
entitled to the sort of respectability which attaches to a case put
hypothetically, nor to the honour of an "if;" and I must remind your
correspondent that in a Junius question "general belief" is no evidence.
Every story, however absurd, once asserted, is "generally believed,"
until some one (a rare and exceptional case) proves that it is not
true&mdash;probably that it could not be true. The general belief, for
example, that the "Letter to a Brigadier" was written by Junius, is not,
so far as I know, supported by a tittle of evidence. It is all assertion
and assumption, founded on the opinion of A., B., and C., as to "style,"
&amp;c. Now, as some two dozen different persons have been proved, by like
confident opinions, on like evidence, to be the writer of <i>Junius's
Letters</i>, I may be excused when I acknowledge that the test is not with
me quite conclusive. In respect, however, to this "Letter to a
Brigadier," Mr. Britton and Sir David Brewster have proceeded somewhat
further. Having, with others, come to the conclusion that Junius was the
writer, Mr. Britton proceeds to show that Barré served in Canada under
Wolfe, and was the very man, from circumstances, position, and feelings,
who could, would, and did write that letter. Sir David endeavours to
show that Macleane was in like circumstance, stimulated by like
feelings, and was the veritable Simon; founding his argument mainly on
the belief that Macleane was also serving there as surgeon of Otway's
regiment. It has been shown in the <i>Athenæum</i> that Macleane never was
surgeon of Otway's regiment, and that in all probability he never was in
Canada: in brief, that the memoir is a mistake from beginning to end. As
all, however, that is urged by Sir David in favour of Macleane, as one
who had served under Wolfe, may be thought to strengthen, to that
extent, the claim of Barré, who certainly did so serve, and was severely
wounded, let us look at the facts.</p>

<p>Barré was wounded at the capture of Quebec; and, under date of Oct.
1759, Knox, in his <i>Historical Journal</i>, says, "Colonel Carlton and
Major Barré retired to the southward for the recovery of their wounds."
From his letter to Mr. Pitt (<i>Chath. Corr.</i>), we find that Barré was at
New York, April 28, 1760. He appears subsequently to have joined Amherst
before Montreal; and on the capture of Montreal, on Sept. 8, 1760, he
was appointed to convey the despatches to England, and arrived in London
on the 5th October. These are facts public and unquestioned&mdash;admitted by
Mr. Britton.</p>

<p>Now for a fact out of the "Letter to a Brigadier." I could give you half
a dozen of like character, but space is precious, and one, I think, will
be sufficient. The writer quotes <i>in extenso</i> a letter written by
Townshend, published in <i>The Daily Advertiser</i>, and dated "South Audley
Square, 20th June, 1760." Mr. Britton admits that the pamphlet must have
been published "some time before the 5th October, as on that day a
Refutation appeared;" it was, in fact, reviewed, or rather abused, in
the <i>Critical Review</i> for September. We have proof, therefore, that the
"Letter to a Brigadier" was written after 20th June, and founded, in
part, on facts known <i>in London</i> only on the 21st of June at the
earliest: the probabilities are that it was published in August or
September, certainly before the 5th October. How then could it have been
written by a man in America, serving before Montreal?</p>

<h3>
<span>MAPS OF AFRICA.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 261.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I do not know why, because a man publishes maps of Africa at Gotha, they
should not be "fancy portraits," any more than why a man's book should
be a good one, because it is printed on a composition which nobody but a
German would have the effrontery to call paper.</p>

<p>I had seen Spruner's Map a few weeks after it came out, and the
conclusion I came to about it at the time was, that it was certainly a
fancy portrait. I shall be glad to be shown that I am in error; and, as
I am more sure of the fact that I did come to this conclusion after some
examination, than I am of the argument whereby I arrived at it&mdash;for my
memory is singularly gifted in this way&mdash;I should be obliged by E. C.
H., or any of your correspondents, informing me what grounds there are
for believing Spruner, or any one else, to have produced a map or maps
of the north coast of Africa between long. 5° west, and 25° east of
Greenwich, or any portion of the said coast,&mdash;said map or maps being the
result of actual survey. Moreover, if I further inquire when any survey
whatever took place of this coast at any time, and profess my utter
ignorance of the history of our present <i>North</i> African maps, and my
great doubts of their credibility, let not your correspondents imagine
that this is one of a <i>few</i> things that I ought to be acquainted with,
and really know nothing whatever about.</p>

<p>&mdash;To the numerous list of men
whose services to literature our English biographers have injudiciously
omitted to record may be added James Wilson, M.D. As editor of the
<i>Mathematical tracts</i> of Mr. Benjamin Robins in 1761, he has often been
noticed with commendation. Beyond that circumstance, all is obscurity.</p>

<p>He wrote, however, a valuable <i>Dissertation on the rise and progress of
the modern art of navigation</i>, which was first published by Mr. John
Robertson in his <i>Elements of navigation</i> in 1764, and republished by
him in 1772. The authors shall now speak for themselves:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"This edition [of the <i>Elements of navigation</i>] is also enriched
   with the history of the art of navigation; for with the author's

Depping. Paris, 1830. 8vo. 2 vols. This subject was proposed in 1826, as
a prize essay, by the Académie royale des inscriptions et
belles-lettres, and M. Depping was the successful competitor. The prize,
a gold medal of the value of 1500 francs, was awarded in 1828. M. le
baron Silvestre de Sacy, whose profound acquaintance with oriental
history and literature enabled him to detect some slight errors in the
work, thus concludes his review of it in the <i>Journal des savants</i>:

<h4>
<span><i>English Translation of the Canons</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 246.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;M. tells us
that in the second clause of the 36th canon of 1603, the words <i>quodque
eodem taliter uti liceat</i> are translated "and that the same may be
lawfully used," the word <i>taliter</i> being altogether omitted in the
English. What authority is there for this statement? In all the copies
of the English Canons that I have examined, the translation is exact,
viz., "and that it may lawfully <i>so</i> be used;" and that the form now
presented for subscription at ordination agrees with this, may be
inferred from the fact that the words are so printed in Mr. Hodgson's
<i>Instructions for the Clergy</i> (6th edition, p. 8.).</p>

<p>It would seem that M. has confounded with the Canons of 1603 an older
form, which was prescribed by Archbishop Whitgift in 1584 (Cardwell,
<i>Docum. Annals</i>, i. 414.). The words of that form agree with your
correspondent's quotation; and it has also a bearing on his assumption
that the 36th canon was originally presented for subscription in Latin,
and that the English version has been wrongfully substituted. Not only
is there (as I believe) no proof of this assumption; but we have the
fact that a set of <i>English</i> articles, substantially the same with those
of the 36th canon of 1603 (or rather 1604), was subscribed for twenty
years before the body of the canons existed.</p>

<span><i>Few Descents through a long Period.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The pedigree of the noble family
of Dartmouth, given by Edmondson in his <i>Baronagium Genealogicum</i>, No.
197., contains an extraordinary instance of few descents through a long
period of time.</p>

<p>The stock of descent is Thomas Legge, Sheriff of London in 1343, and
Lord Mayor in 1346. He had a son, Simon, whose son, Thomas, had issue,
William, who had issue an only son, Edward. This Edward had thirteen
children, one of whom, John, is stated to have died in 1702, aged 109.
Supposing Thomas Legge to have been 46 years old at his Mayoralty
(<i>i.e.</i> born in 1300) these six lives would extend over more than 400
years. This is so extraordinary that I append a Query. Is Edmondson's
<i>Genealogy</i> correct, or are there any intermediate descents omitted?</p>

<p>The ages at death of four only of Edward's children are given, and they,
too, are remarkable: the before-mentioned John, aged 109 years;
Elizabeth (unmarried), 105 years; Margaret (married &mdash;&mdash; Fitzgerald,
Esq.), 105 years; and Anne (married &mdash;&mdash; Anthony, Esq.), 112 years. Can
any of your correspondents inform me the years when any of these died,
or where they are buried? to enable me to verify these facts by
certificates.</p>

   inclined to think that we should look for the derivation where it
   is not generally sought, and here too we must turn to Spain for
   the explanation. It has much perplexed inquirers, and two
   explanations of it are current; one of which traces it up to the
   early Normans, while they yet retained their northern tongue, and
   to their often adjuration by the name of God, with sometimes
   reference to a famous scene in French history, in which Rollo,
   Duke of Normandy, played a conspicuous part; the other puts it in
   connexion with 'Beguines,' often called in Latin 'Beguttæ,' a
   name by which certain communities of pietest women were known in
   the Middle Ages. Yet I cannot but think it probable, that rather
   than to either of these sources, we owe the word to that mighty
   impression which the Spaniards began to make upon all Europe in
   the fifteenth century, and made for a long time after. Now the
   word 'bigote' means in Spanish 'mustachio;' and, as contrasted
   with the smooth or nearly smooth upper lip of most other people,
   at that time the Spaniards were the 'men of the mustachio.' That
   it was their characteristic feature comes out in Shakspeare's
   <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, where Armado, the 'fantastical Spaniard,'
   describes the king, 'his familiar, as sometimes being pleased to
   lean on his poor shoulder, and dally with his mustachio.' [Act V.
   Sc. 1.] That they themselves connected firmness and resolution
   with the mustachio, that it was esteemed the outward symbol of
   these, is plain from such phrases as 'hombre de bigote,' a man of
   resolution; 'tener bigotes,' to stand firm. But that in which
   they eminently displayed their firmness and resolution in those
   days, was their adherence to whatever the Roman See required and
   taught. What then more natural, or more entirely according to the
   law of the generation of names, than that this striking and
   distinguishing outward feature of the Spaniard should have been
   laid hold of to express that character and condition which
   eminently were his, and then transferred to all others who shared
   the same? The mustachio is, in like manner, in France a symbol of
   military courage; and thus 'un vieux moustache,' is an old
   soldier of courage and military bearing. And strengthening this
   view, the earliest use of the word which Richardson gives, is a
   passage from Bishop Hall, where 'bigot' is used to signify a
   pervert to Romanism: 'he was turned both <i>bigot</i> and physician.'
   In further proof that the Spaniard was in those times the
   standing representative of the bigot and the persecutor, we need
   but turn to the older editions of Fox's <i>Book of Martyrs</i>, where
   the Pagan persecutors of the early Christians are usually arrayed
   in the armour of Spanish soldiers, and sometimes graced with
   tremendous 'bigotes.'"&mdash;2nd edit. 80-82.</p>

<p>Mr. Trench's derivation of <i>bigot</i> is, I think, very preferable to those
you cite.</p>

<p>&mdash;I am not aware that
it was ever any secret, or, at any rate, that there is any occasion to

neither did I ever hear of its suppression. The satire is certainly
somewhat severe; but even those who fell under its lash could scarcely
deny its great ability, or the high poetical talent which it evinced.
Such as knew the marvellous promise of his youth can never cease to
lament that it pleased God to bring the author's life to a premature and
unhappy close.</p>

<span><i>Sir Thomas Frowyk</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 295.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Thomas Frowyk was, in all
likelihood, of a family long connected with the government of London.
According to Fuller, he was born at Ealing in Middlesex, and was son of
Thomas Frowyk, Esq. [if I do not greatly err he was knighted in or
before the reign of Richard III.] of Gunnersbury, by the daughter and
heiress of Sir John Sturgeon, knight. He was "bred in the study of our
municipal law," and read on the statute Prerogative Regis (17 Edw. II.
stat. 1.), but in what inn of court, or in what year, I have not seen
stated. He was (with others) made serjeant-at-law, by writ tested 10th
September, 1496. The feast was kept on the 16th of November following,
at Ely House in Holborn, "where dined the King, Queen, and all the chief
lords of England." He was afterwards one of the King's serjeants. On the
11th July, 1502, he (with Mr. Justice Fisher and Humphrey Conyngsbye,
one of the King's serjeants) made an award between the University and
town of Cambridge adjusting disputes between the two bodies, and
defining in minute detail their respective jurisdictions. On the 30th
September, 1502, he was constituted Lord Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, and was, at or about the same time, knighted. In 19 Hen. VIII. he
was, by Act of Parliament, appointed one of the feoffees to the use of
the King's will. He died 17th October, 1505, being, as it is said, under
forty years old. He was buried, with Joan his wife, in the church of
Finchley. He left a large estate to his two daughters, of whom Elah, the
eldest, was married to Sir John Spelman, Justice of the King's Bench,
"grandfather to Sir Henry, that renowned knight." Sir Thomas Frowyk's
arms (azure a cheveron between 3 leopards' faces or) were in a window of
the hall of Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street; and the same coat (quartering
Sturgeon and another) was in a window at St. Dunstan's in the West.

of the lines on Dr. Fell. They were written on the celebrated Dr. Parr,

Fell," I do not know. I have often heard my dear mother repeat the
lines:</p>

<p>The metre of the third line would be more perfect by the addition of the
dissyllable; but the lines I have so often heard want this.</p>

<p>My mother was very intimate with the Sheridan family, and many years
agone she informed me that Miss Jane Linley (afterwards Mrs. Ward) told
her that young Tom Sheridan composed the foregoing lines on Dr. Parr.</p>

   inspire with courage those who had to struggle with the evils and
   casualties of life, and to reinvigorate those who were exhausted
   by the labours of husbandry.... Hence it became a custom to place
   his image in conspicuous places, to paint it of colossal size on
   the walls of churches and houses, where it is sometimes seen
   occupying the whole height of the building, and is visible from a
   great distance, being considered as a good omen for all those who
   look upon it. A mountain in Granada, which is first seen by ships

and reading men, of a library of circulation of works of a higher class
than those to be met with in ordinary subscription libraries, has just
been rendered evident by the publication of the second volume of its
<i>Catalogue</i>.</p>

<p>From this it appears that there are now in this admirable
collection&mdash;for it is an admirable one&mdash;fifteen thousand distinct works
(upwards, we believe, of forty-five thousand volumes), comprising the
best and most expensive works in every department of learning, which
scholars and men of learning may have the use of in their own studies
for the small subscription of two pounds a year. There is little wonder
that the plan has succeeded, for it has been well carried out,&mdash;thanks
to the zeal of the Managing Committee, and to the care and attention of
Mr. Cochrane, its able and most efficient Librarian.</p>

<p><i>The History of the Restoration of Monarchy in France</i>, by Alphonse de
Lamartine. Volume the Second.&mdash;The brilliant and eloquent narrative
contained in this volume includes the period between Napoleon's
departure from Fontainebleau and his abdication. In the course of this
history we are presented with scene after scene which dazzle us with all
the gorgeous colouring of a panorama; but which, when we come to look
into their details, are found to be almost as obscure and indefinite as
the objects in those attractive works of art to which we have likened
them. The work has all the charms of a romance; but we fear purchases
this reputation by sacrificing the more sober requirements of a history.</p>

<p><i>Lectures and Addresses in Aid of Popular Education</i>, by the Right Hon.
the Earl of Carlisle.&mdash;It would be difficult to find a more faithful or
a more gratifying type of the present age than this new part of <i>The
Traveller's Library</i>, in which we see one of England's "belted earls,"
and one of the most amiable and accomplished men of his time, recording
the experiences of his travels; and inviting to join him in the delights
which he has gathered from literary pursuits,&mdash;not a crowd of titled
listeners, but "a band of the hard-handed working men" fresh from the
anvil and the loom.</p>

<p><i>Were Heretics ever burned at Rome? A Report of the Proceedings of the
Roman Inquisition against Fulgentio Manfredi, taken from the Original
Manuscript brought from Italy by a French Officer, and edited, with a
parallel English Version, and Notes</i>, by the Rev. Richard Gibbings,
M.A.&mdash;The <i>Dublin Review</i> for June 1850 having boldly asserted as a
fact, that "the Roman Inquisition&mdash;that is to say, the tribunal which
was immediately subject to the control and direction of the Popes
themselves, in their own city, has never been known to order the
execution of capital punishment"&mdash;the Rev. Richard Gibbings has
published, in contradiction of such assertion, this important document,
in the history of Father Fulgentio, who was hanged and burned in the
<i>Campo di Fiore</i>.</p>
